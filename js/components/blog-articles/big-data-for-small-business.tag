    <h3>Big Data For Small Business</h3>

    <span class="blog_meta">James Hines / March 3, 2018</span>

    <p> One of the most compelling use cases for \"Big Data\" is to create what is called a 360 degree view of a
        customer. This is the idea that a company can get a more complete view of their customers by aggregating data
        from the various touch points customers may use to contact a company to purchase products or to receive service
        and support. </p>
    <p> This 360-degree view can help businesses determine what kinds of products or services their customers might buy
        next, or do a better job of targeting messages to specific groups of customers. </p>
    <p>In days past, aggregating data from various sources has been so resource intensive in terms of compute power
        alone that only large companies with access to data centers could do it. When those sources have to be
        aggregated by hand, it becomes prohibitively expensive for small and midsized businesses. In 2018, your small
        business can leverage services like Google Cloud Compute or Amazon Web Services to put you on a level playing
        field with a Fortune 500 company. Well, at least in terms of compute power. The best part about using these
        services is that you only pay for what you use. </p>

    <p> Now that you know it's possible for your small business to automate the process of aggregating customer data
        from various sources in an affordable way, what do you do with it? Ultimately, you'll want to be able to ask
        questions in plain English, and get answers that are easy to understand. That's were I believe I can help. I'll
        work with you to determine what areas of your business you'd like to improve and we'll go from there. One thing
        to keep in mind for small and midsized businesses trying to leverage the data they already have, is that Big
        data is not all about having unlimited amounts of information — it’s more about receiving high-quality
        information in a timely manner that is specific to your business. </p>
    <p> Data is giving rise to a new economy. In many of the same ways that oil has been crucial to driving the world
        economy most of us are familiar with, data powers the online services and devices that form a digital economy.
        Even if you're running a decidedly non-technical business in this age of smartphones and social media, you're
        still very much a part of it. </p>
    <p> A 360-degree customer view is only the beginning. Once you've begun the process of centralizing your data you
        can do things like create better marketing campaigns and make sense of social media. Start using your data to
        transform your business into a smarter, more efficient organization today! </p>
